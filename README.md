# Login-App
2-tier login page

Client-Server Architecture:
A Java client login GUI takes username and password inputs, makes a request to MySQL database to verify if users are valid.
A Java client sign-up GUI takes username, email and password inputs to add users to the MySQL database. 

The Sign Up page of the Java executable takes username input and makes a request to the database to confirm if that username is available.
Moreover, the client GUI checks if a valid email and password has been entered.

After verifying username and password, the client GUI opens a home page for the user. This home page is populated with each users personalized data.
